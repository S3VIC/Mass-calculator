Hi,
My name is Seweryn and I'm a nanostructeres engineering student. My programming experience began exactly with a decision of apllying on such kind of studies. C++ is for now my main programming language. I'm also planning to attempt electronics studies as it is strongly connected with what im interested in. First project I'm trying to complete is to make a simple mass calculator which will also provide more specific information about each element.

# Mass-calculator
The aim of this project is to create a simple terminal app, mass calculator based on given numbers of chosen elements/isotopes.
Language used C++.
